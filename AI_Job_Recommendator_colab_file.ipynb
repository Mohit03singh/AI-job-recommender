            "Although the user's primary skillset is in frontend development, their experience in design principles could be valuable in a UI/UX designer role. The user's artistic eye and understanding of user experience could be beneficial in this position. Additionally, the company is the same as the frontend developer role, which could be an attractive option.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: I'm not recommending the Backend Engineer - Java role at FinTech Secure as the user's skills and experience are not a match for this role. The Python Developer Intern and Data Science Intern roles at Tech Innovations Inc. and Data Insights Co. are also not suitable options as they require different skill sets and experience.\n",
